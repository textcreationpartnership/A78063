            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>And there ſhall be Signs in the Sun, and in the Moon, and in the Stars, And upon the Earth, Diſtreſs of Nations, with Perplexitie, the Sea, and the Waves Roaring, Mens Hearts failing them for Fear, and for looking after thoſe things which are coming on the Earth.

            </epigraph>
            <p>THere is Prophetick mention of two Fatal Times, as they are fore ſhewn by the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> and by our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt. [There ſhall be</hi>

For if we obſerve, He adds ſaying <hi>[then</hi> (as much as to ſay when you ſee thoſe <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.</note> Signs) <hi>ſhall they ſee the Son of Man coming in a Cloud, with Power and great Glory: And when theſe things begin to come to paſs, then look up, and lift up your Hands, for your Redemption draweth nigh.]</hi> And as ſure as the Sprout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fig-tree, is a Prodromer that Summer is at Hand,

The Total Sum of all which things Amounts thus far, That the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhall be converted, to the Chriſtian Faith, and then ſhall be delivered out of Captivity by the mighty Power of God, and be reſtored unto their own Ancient Country and Land, called <hi>Paleſtina;</hi> but <hi>[immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe Days ſhall be great Tribulation, ſuch as was not</hi>

For Obſerve we, Firſt, That the Daily Sacrifice ceaſed on the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> in the Year of Chriſts Incarnation 70, for want of Victims, next the Abomination began to ſtand
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:171684:6"/> up, on the ſame Year, and on the next Month when Idol Sacrifice was layd upon Gods Alter, and when the moſt holy place, by Fire was Converted into Rubbiſh, and was Troden with profane Feet, and continuing in its Aſhes, it was made deſolate. But eſpecially the Abomination and Deſolation was then perfected at what time Idol Temples were erected in the Place of Gods Houſe, &amp; the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> utterly driven away Root and Branch, out of the whole Kingdom, by <hi>Aelius Hadrianus.</hi> And this Abomination of Deſolation, and Ceſſation of dayly Sacrifice laſted until the Reign of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great the firſt Chriſtian Emperour; who in the 7th.

Here therefore end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Abomination, &amp; the daily Sacrifice being reſtored; Hence are we to begin the firſt Term of <hi>Daniels</hi> Times, and to reckon onwards. The times mentioned are two, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">

And now count we from the Year of Chriſt 313, an Addition of 1290 Years, and they will ſet us in the Year of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 1603. Which is the very Year whereon King <hi>James</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi> and began to poſſeſs the Crown of great <hi>Britain,</hi> and on the ſame Year was the Saventh great <hi>Conjunction</hi> in the Fiery Triplicity, and at the end of the Year was a new Star in Seventeen degrees of <hi>Sagita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> And the ſecond Term mentioned by <hi>Daniel,</hi> which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:171684:6"/> bounded his 1290 Years was the Time, Times, and an half. So as 'twas not the deliverance of his People, which at end of thoſe Years was forſhewn, for the Years are long ſince come up and gone by, and no ſuch thing is done, and the fore it follows, that at end of this Date, or Term of Time, the other mentioned by the ſame Author is to take place. And thus after 1290 Years from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination of Deſolation ſet up, is to follow a Time, Times, and an half, and then is to be expected the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. And ſo from the coming into <hi>England</hi> of King <hi>James,</hi> there was to be expected a Time, and Times, and an half, and then ſhall follow the Reſtoration of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And whether we will have it the time of Reign of One King, and Two Kings, and an Interregnum, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other way, and whether we will eſteem theſe times to be reckoned by our Kings Reigns in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> or at <hi>Rome,</hi> it cannot be long to the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>

            <p>Theſe vvords are foreboding marks of thoſe Days of Tribulation I have mentioned before, and a diſcription of the State of that Tribulation, and the ground Plot of both.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Marks foreboding are called Signs, and are Deſcribed by their Scituation either in the <hi>Sun,</hi> or <hi>Moon,</hi> or <hi>Stars,</hi> or on the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Signs</hi> in the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> are all extraordinary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Eclipſes, as when Total, and the Stars appear by Day, or is accompanyed with ſtrange Meteors or Conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. Unuſual and Stange Colour, ſuch as black or bloudy, or pale and dark for any long time. Unuſual ſhapes, ſuch as extraordinary big or ſmall, or when Croſſes or other Signs appear in the Bodys of either.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Signs</hi> in the <hi>Stars</hi> are when new <hi>Stars, Comets</hi> or unuſual Meteors do appear, and that of horrible Colours, ſhapes, quantity, and bigneſs, and do laſt long or do miſcheif.

            </p>
            <p>Signs upon Earth are Monſtrous Births, Apparitions of Ghoſts, ſtrange Thunders, Hail-Storms, Froſts, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, moving of Mountains, Trees, Houſes, or Towns, prodigious Winds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Strange Voices heard and not known whence they come. Raining of Bloud, Wool, Wheat, Stones or ſuch like. Breaking forth of new Wells, Rivers, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>Now theſe things are wont to be aboundantly more plenteous in <hi>Pagan</hi> Countrys, then in Chriſtian, becauſe where God teacheth by his word, there is the leſs need of the warning by ſtrange Prodigies. And 2ly, becauſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:171684:8"/> where we know to deſpiſe Signs and Wonders, they paſs over the leſs noted or headed, but where Men do moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, <hi>Sathan</hi> makes ſhew oftentimes of greater wonders then really they are; and counterfeit ſtrange Signs.</p>
            <p>Before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was ſeen a Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Comet</hi> in form of a Sword, which hung over <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a whole Year.

And what was moſt of all, one <hi>Jeſus</hi> Son of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi> for four Years together went about the City continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pronouncing Woes againſt the City, Country, and Temple, and no Whipping or Puniſhment would make him ceaſe. Now never were more greivous Calamities then befel that place at that time. And yet we Read of greater and more grievous Signes, before the Falling down of the <hi>Northern</hi> Inundations about the Year of 400, vvhen the <hi>Goths, Vandals, Hunns</hi> and ſuch like barbarous People over ran the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. And far vvorſe before the Maſſacre of <hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Britain</hi> in <hi>Neroes</hi> Time, And the Maſſacre of <hi>Romans</hi> by <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and the taking of <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Gaules.</hi> And yet before the Fearful Maſſacre at <hi>Paris</hi> in 72 vve Read of very mean Prodigies boding thereof. The truth is, there Lurks much of Learning in the Caſe, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies and ſtrange Signs are Significant, but they require an Interpretor, there is a curioſity in the Signification, more then every body knovvs, only thus far vve knovv, that ſuch things are Direful vvhere-ever the danger Lights, and in common Threatnings all Men are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvare.</p>
            <p>Now to take a view of the prodigies of our own Age at preſent, depending with their Woes looking in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are firſt a prodigious Hailſtorm in <hi>London,</hi> and Ten Miles round, on the 18th. of <hi>May,</hi> 1680.

And laſtly, on <hi>Jan.</hi> 17. vvas a viſible Eclipſe of the <hi>Sun</hi> in the 8th. of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> almoſt Total in the <hi>Weſtern Horiſon.</hi> And beſides theſe are talkt of ſeveral Viſions ſeen in the Ayr, and noyſe of Drums beating, heard, no Man knovvs from vvhence, and ſtrange Propheſies of Deſtruction and much Miſchief attending us, and great Rumours of Wars every vvhere. But the Pulpit is no place to tell ſtrange ſtories in; I ſhall omit therefore the crovvd of Hereſays, of Mock <hi>Suns</hi> and <hi>Moons,</hi> and ſeveral Vapours, beſides re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of nevv Springs and Rivers broken out, vvhich ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver vvere vvont to ſhevv themſelves but againſt times of extremity. And novv vvhat theſe things ſignifie belong not unto this place to decide; but do rather lead me to give vvarning, that in ſuch caſes every body do fear the vvorſt, and the beſt vvill mend it ſelf. That is, God ſends theſe vvarnings that vve may repent of our ſins, and in expectation of danger, to ſtick the cloſer unto our God, in all holineſs of Converſation. And this the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the next place, vve are forevvarned that after theſe Signs ſhall follovv, <hi>Diſtreſs of Nations with Perplexity, the Sea and the Waves roaring, Mens Hearts failing them</hi>

               <hi>for fear, and for looking after thoſe things which are coming on the Earth.</hi> Here in this Propheſie have vve firſt deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the thing forevvarned, <hi>[Diſtreſs of Nations]</hi> Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that after the Signs aforeſaid, not all the vvhole World, but yet Nations, ſeveral Nations, vvhomſoever it may concern, ſhall be greatly diſtreſſed; that is, they ſhall ſuffer great Aſſaults, and ſhall be much Tottered and Shaken, or Overturned, and ſhall have no Supporters, or Aſſiſters, to preſerve from a fall, or to raiſe up being down: Or in ſhort, They ſhall have ſo great troubles, that they will not know which way to turn them in order to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. 2. Is deſcribed the height of this diſtreſs; that is, <hi>[with Perplexity]</hi> Intimating that their Calamities ſhall be like unto a Line intangled and knit into ſo many knots that it cannot be undone; They feeling themſelves lock't up, and fenced about with abundance of Dangers threatning, and yet ſo puzled with Miſchief upon Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, as if the untying of one knot, were the making of three. 3. Is ſet forth the Form and Shape of the Diſtreſs, as being like the hideous Waves of the Sea, Roaring, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and Threatning, and Foming with Salt Froth, as if they would Swallow and Devour all before them. For as the Sea in rough Water is fearful to behold, and dangerous to be truſted, ſuch are the dreadful approaching Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. 4. Is ſhewed the Effects of this Diſtreſs. 1. In Mens Hearts which ſhall fail for fear, And 2ly. In their Eyes which ſhall increaſe the fears of the Heart, by ſeeing and beholding the Miſeries as they approach nearer and nearer, and the great Miſchief which they do. <hi>[The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a Man (ſaith</hi> Solomon) <hi>will bear its Infirmities,</hi>

               <hi>but a wounded Spirit who can bear?]</hi> The Heart is the ſupport of a Mans Spirit, and ſo long as the Heart holds up ſtout and confident, it carries him off through many temptations: but if a Mans Heart fail him, then all his Spirits break, and evaporate into meer Air and Emptineſs.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:171684:9"/> And the Heart failing, Man lifts up his Eyes, as if they ſhould help him, and yet they by ſeeing, and beholding the great Clouds of approaching Evils do rather increaſe and heighten the Sorrow, while they have no tydings to tell but of grievous Miſchief and Miſeries continually threatning, and yet can they not chuſe but look up ſtill, though they can behold no Comfort.

               <hi>of trembling, where is nothing but fear, without hopes of Peace. Wherefore (ſaith the Lord) do I ſee every Man with his hands on his Loyns, as a Woman in Travail, (as if Man alſo ſhould Travail with Child) and all Faces are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into paleneſs. Alas, for that day is great, ſo that none is like it: It is the time of</hi> Jacobs <hi>trouble.]</hi> This was when the <hi>Caldeans</hi> oppreſſed and over-ran the whole Kingdom of <hi>Judea,</hi> but at that time they were delivered. Even ſuch are the Calamities that are now approaching upon the World, and ſome Nations perhaps may eſcape with ſmall harms, and others may be ſafe enough: But ſome where, and on ſome certain Nations, theſe great Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, the like whereof were never before knovvn, are novv like to happen in a ſhort ſpace. <hi>For now the Powers of Heaven are ſhaken,</hi> as our Saviour ſaith in my Text, <hi>For the Powers of Heaven ſhall be ſhaken.</hi> And this is the third thing, the Cauſe and Ground vvork both of the Signs and the Miſeries forevvarned. The Povvers of Heaven are either Efficiently or Inſtrumentally ſo Efficiently and Principally are, God himſelf, and after him his Holy Angels, the Povvers of Heaven. Inſtrumentally the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> and all the Hoſts of Heaven, are the Povvers and Strength of Heaven, by vvhich according to Nature God Acts upon Earth. Novv God and his Angels are too high to be ſhaken, but their Inſtruments may be ſhaken, and that either vvhen God ſhall ſhake them, as a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:171684:10"/> Man ſhakes his Weapon when he brandiſheth his Sword to ſtrike therewith. And thus God ſhakes the Powers of Heaven, when the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> ſeeming to daſh one againſt another, either by Body or Aſpect, do make even the Earth and all its Inhabitants to ſhake and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at their Motions. And here alſo the Potentates on Earth, in a ſenſe called the Powers of Heaven, becauſe the God of Heavens Agents, are alſo ſhaken by the greater Powers of Heaven above. And thus the late gaeat <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> and the great <hi>Eclipſes,</hi> and the great <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> now in being, are the ſhaking of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, our Saviour ſpeaks of; And after theſe, its to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, many Prodigies and Signs will ſtill appear more and more both in Heaven and Earth, until the forewarned Diſtreſs of Nations doth come upon them. Now what theſe <hi>Comets, Eclipſes,</hi> and <hi>Conjunctions</hi> do ſignifie, belongs not to this place or time to be Treated on; nor yet do I think my ſelf concerned to ſay how near or how far off thoſe threatened Calamities are unto the Nations. Only ſuppoſing the worſt, give me leave by help of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text to deſcribe them ſo far as Gods Word gives us warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo I ſhall come to Application.</p>
            <p>Now to this purpoſe we are to note, that at this time of my Text, our Saviour is upon Anſwer to three Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions. As 1. When ſhall theſe things be, meaning the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> vvhich a little afore, Chriſt had been Treating upon. 2. What ſhall be the Sign of Chriſts <note place="margin">

Unto all vvhich our Saviour anſvvers comprehenſively, as if, vvhat is the Sign of the one, ſhall be the ſame of all three. And look hovv it is like to be in that day, vvhen the vvhole World of Heaven and Earth are to Periſh by Fire, and be Deſtroyed, even ſo after the ſame rate ſhall it happen vvhen <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is to be Deſtroyed,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:171684:10"/> and when the <hi>Gentile</hi> Nations are many or moſt of them to be diſtreſſed. For at each of all theſe three times ſhall be great Tribulation, ſuch as the like was never known before, beſides or ſince, excepting the very Paralels. Of theſe the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is paſt, the Calamity of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Nations even now waits them. And the end of the World ſhall come in its time.</p>

               <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> the <hi>Grand Seigniour,</hi> unto whom they were but Slaves or Common Subjects. And accordingly they Summoned him with a Writ of Juſtice, (called a <hi>Stelfa,)</hi> before them, to Anſwer his Miſdemeanours; which Writ he not Obeying, though Twice or Thrice repeated, They Condemned him to Death; and expoſed him to be firſt impriſoned, and afterwards Murdered.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:171684:12"/> whole Sany dryn or high Court of juſtice. Here alſo was a King, then whom never Prince better had deſerved at the hands of his People, by all mens, and very Enemies, confeſſion, who tendered the welfare of his Subjects, even as a Mother would do by her Sucking Child; ſo truly humble, ſo exceeding gracious, ſo Heavenly Pious and Devout in all Points, ſo meek, ſo harmleſs, as any Dove, and yet wiſe, unto Admiration, as a Serpent, ſo Faithful to his Oath, ſo obſervant of Duty to God and Man, as rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was the like ſo gracious and Heavenly Prince ever known. And yet they drove him from his Houſe and Home, and rendered him in worſe State then the Foxes vvhich have Holes, they purſued him, and ſet forth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>climation after him, that if any Man knevv vvhere he was, he muſt reveal it to the tvvo Houſes, they caught him by Treachery of Money, betrayed by a <hi>Judas</hi> of his ovvn Houſe, more then one and another, they Impriſoned Him, and left him careleſly, as it had been on purpoſe, that the Army might ſeize on him, They led him up and dovvn in Triumph, Voted no more <hi>Addreſſes</hi> to him, and Finally they <hi>Spat</hi> on him, <hi>Mock'd</hi> him, <hi>Scorn'd</hi> him, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Juſtice, Juſtice,</hi> at him, and <hi>Execution, Execution,</hi> againſt him, as others once ſaid <hi>Crucifie, Crucifie,</hi> him.

Thus Died our Soveraign much after the manner as did our Saviour, and was as Honourably Buried by honourable Men, and was after the ſame Rate heartily and bitterly Lamented, both by Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who ſtood afar off with Loud Lamentation and out Cries, and ſmote their Breaſts and ſo Returned.

Then let the <hi>Jews</hi> look up; for they are riſen up who have equalled their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the Redemption of the <hi>Jews</hi> therefore draweth nigh. But as for us, we have great Reaſon God knows to look down, and let all wiſe Men conſider it! <hi>The</hi> Iriſh <hi>Rebels</hi> in 1641, <hi>who Murdered ſo many Thouſand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> have in ſome meaſure taſted Divine Vengeance for the ſame.

But our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rebels, whether <hi>Presbyterians, Indipendants,</hi> or others, who Murdered the <hi>Two great Witneſſes</hi> of Gods Houſe, the <hi>Biſhop</hi> firſt, and then the <hi>King,</hi> and that not Treacherouſly and Raſhly, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in <hi>France</hi> did by the two Royal <hi>Henry</hi>'s there; but ſolemnly and in <hi>cold Bloud,</hi> by a <hi>Court of Judicature,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titling

Theſe were Saintly Rebels who did theſe things, and therefore it ſeems as if God has deſigned to make it known to all the World, how much they were Diabolical Hipocrites: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, no doubt, were truly good Men, meerly drawn in and deluded, and theſe have had ſpace of Repentance, which was not in vain unto them. But the reſt vvere Vile Deceivers, vvho meerly counterfeited Saintſhip, and therefore the King Pardoned them, in expectation, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly Penitent, of their own Selves, and out of their ovvn Hearts, they would have Reſtored ill-gotten-Goods, Reformed their Lives, and have Implored Gods Pardon at the Throne of Grace; and God has given them full time, as He did once by the Murtherers of Chriſt, that they may remain without all Exception, that it may be ſeen to the uttermoſt, if ought of Goodneſs abide in them. But inſtead thereof, being grown worſe and worſe, and now at laſt retaining a meer Naked Name of Religion, fraught with Malice and Hypocriſie, and haſtening unto new Rebellions Daily, upon the very Old Principles, without any thing of the ſigns of true Piety, they ſeem even dropping Ripe for Vengeance. For though true it is, that his preſent Majeſty has fully granted them Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and no doubt he did well in it, becauſe it was his Fathers Will, it ſhould be ſo, and we ought to have the utmoſt Veneration for the Commands of Dying Parents,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:171684:15"/> and eſpecially for Saintly Ones, ſuch as the Father in this Caſe certainly was. In Obedience therefore to that Command, the King has Pardoned, and no Man beneath the King, can therefore deny or diſanul the ſame, and Woe be to that Man who ſhall yet think of ſuch a thing! And ſeeing the King and his Cavaliers have fully Pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who ſhall Condemn? But Ah, Alas, theſe Pardons extend only unto Exemption from Corporal Puniſhment by the Pardoners, but tend nothing at all towards an Expiation with God, without true Repentance for their Bloudy Crimes. And in caſe of Rapine and Blood, it ſeems no Tears nor Ails of Confeſſion, can be eſteemed with God Penitential enough, without Reſtitution and <note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 19, &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 27, 28, 29.</note> Satisfaction, at leaſt, unto the utmoſt of the Penitents Ability. We may remember, That by a Free-Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the Choice of which, neither the King nor the Biſhops, nor hardly any Cavaliers, had Votes, the late War, in a moſt free Debate, has been Adjudged to be a Notorious Rebellion on the Conquerours part, which was the Parliaments ſide, and that the Covenant, which was the Bond of that Conſederacy, deſerved to be Burnt; which if ſo, by what a fair Umpyrage has God then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, at whoſe Door lies all the Blood-guiltineſs! And if ſo, what a Fatal Blood-guiltineſs of Crying Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, lies then at thoſe Mens Doors? What Fearful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of Taxes, Sequeſtrations, and ſuch like, have all Men on that ſide to Anſwer for, before the Tribunal Throne of God? And how many Thouſands are there in City and Countrey, who are made Rich meerly out of the Ruins of Conſciencious, Religious and Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by means of Plunder, and Sequeſtration, and Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and Moneys of Compoſition wring'd out of their Pockets, by an high Hand? With Men indeed, in ſuch a caſe of Rebellion, theſe things were uneaſie to be decided, and therefore, by an Act of general Oblivion,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:171684:15"/> all ſuch matters were reaſonably Pardoned by His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, by Advice of Parliament: but I am ſpeaking now of the Scrutinies of Heaven only, which ſearch into the deepeſt Secrets of all Hearts. The Parties Wrong'd were willing to Pardon, that is, they were contented quietly to let go their Goods, and to let go all benefit of the Law, in order to recover their Rights; but yet neither the King nor the Cavaliers, made any Deed of Gift, in order to Eſtate the Robbers in their Stolen Goods. The Act of Oblivion was pleadable in all Courts, except that of Conſcience, but there it was of no force. Goſpel-Statutes therefore required all Rebels and Thieves, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all Acts of Parliament, tending to Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Excuſe, from Law-ſuits, and from all Recoveries of the Kings Courts, to make their Peace with God by an hearty Repentance, and to make their Peace with the individual wrong'd Parties, either by a Reſtitution, or Satisfaction, or ſome ſuch Acknowledgment and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, of the wrong, as might give content to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wronged. But how few be they who have done this? And now therefore, though neither the King, nor the Cavaliers, have any thought, in the leaſt, of expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any Satisfaction for ſuch old Wrongs. Yet it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the foreboding Signs, that the Time is coming, and is at Hand, wherein God will make Inquiſition for Innocent Blood, and call to Account for theſe things. Be there therefore any Body remaining among theſe guilty Rebels, and King-Killers, who were really good Men, but were beguiled, and thinking they did well, put their Hands to the vvrong, and taſted of the Blood of Gods Witneſſes, the King, or the Biſhop, or their Aiders, and have not to this Day found out the Sin that lurks in the Caſe; it is high time for them to avvake, and look about them, and to make their Peace in time; for the Blood of the Innocent Crys for Vengeance, and the thin
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:171684:16"/> Cheeks, lean Pockets, and Thread-bare-Coats, of poor oppreſſed Cavaliers, do Cry aloud for Vengeance; yea, though the preſent Laws are ſilent in the Caſe, and <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall</hi> makes no Inquiſition in ſuch Caſes.

And ſo ſaid the moſt Reverend Biſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> though there ſhall follow a moſt terrible ſevere Maſſacre, yet the true Saints ſhall moſtly eſcape it, and the formal, hypocritical, and falſe Proteſtants only ſhall periſh. The Papiſts who are to do this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, one would think are but thin among us, ſo far as can be diſcerned; but what ſtore of them lurk in diſguiſe, or what For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prince may be let in, or may break in upon us, God knows. Some way or other its to be feared, they will prevail for a time. I remember the <hi>French</hi> renowned Prophet <hi>Michael Noſtradame,</hi> has a Propheſie of a City Built with Brick, that is to be burnt down, and to be Built again with Marble. If it be <hi>Londons</hi> fate to prove that Building of Brick, there is little to be doubted but afterwards it will be ſeen again cloathed in Marble. But methinks I dread more the Bloud of the People then the Flame of the Houſes. And ſhould the <hi>French</hi> be the Inſtruments of this Bloudy Woe, there is as great likelihood their own <hi>Metropolis</hi> will pay for our Repairs within a few Years after, even Fire for Fire, and Bloud for Bloud. For 'tis but a Factious and Seditious Crew of them, who as it were marked for Vengeance, are ſo haunted by an evil Conſcience, and diabolick Furies, that they cannot reſt till they pull down, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon their own heads, and ruin upon their Families. But ſo ſoon as Gods Work ſhall be done on theſe, there is a Virtuous Breed of Loyal Hearts who never yet bowed knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> who ſhall at once riſe up and deſtroy the Deſtroyers, and burn the chaſtizing Rods.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:171684:18"/> or what to do, in hopes to have help. When Wars ſhall come thick, and Barbarous Souldiers ſhall range about like roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Devils, ſeeking whom they may devour, Robbing, VVounding, and Killing all they meet; then Old and Young will be forc't to Fly as they can, and leaving their Goods to ſave their Lives, in thoſe days what ſhall the poor VVoman do, with a ſmall Child at her Breaſt, or a ſmaller in her Body? Loath ſhe is to hazard the Fruit of her VVomb to ſave her own Life, and therefore She Flies with the Babe in her Arms; till tyred with the Burthen in her Boſom, when 'tis too late, with an heavy heart ſhe leaves it to the Mercies of the Mercileſs, and becomes her ſelf at the next ſtep an Object of the ſame wrath. VVithin the walls She is rather worſe than without; where preſerving Life a few weeks the longer, the Famine bites worſe there, then the Sword did in the Fields. Here the Mother has not Food to ſatisfie her own Hunger, and yet is fain to feed her tender Infant from her Heart-Bloud, until violent Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger conſtraining, neceſſity of Nature draws her in to flay and eat the Fruit of her VVomb to allay the fierce Bitterneſs of inceſſant Hunger. And ſuch was the hardſhip in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that one <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam</hi> a rich Matron, after many conſtraints, having ſodden the Fleſh of her Child to quallifie her hungry Appetite; was rob'd of it when ready to ſit down and eat, by the rude and Seditious Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, led in by the ſmell to find the Prey; and finally, She dyed as Thouſand others did, the painful &amp; lingring death of Famine. But our Saviour has not intailed the whole Flock of Woes on teem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Women alone, but rather inſtanced in one caſe, leaving us to judg of the reſt, and of the whole Body of <hi>Hercules</hi> by his Foot. Hence therefore are we to conceive, or ſaying to our ſelves, woe alſo to the great Rich Men, mighty and wealthy in Mony and Land, whoſe Heart's glued to the World, as faſt as the good Womans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells to her ſucking Infant, when they ſhall ſee their Barns full of Corne all of a light Flame, and their Feilds full of Cattel, quite emptyed, drove and cleared, their Cheſts full of Mony Rifled, their Daughters raviſhed, their Sons Slain in the VVars, &amp; themſelves ſhut out of doors Languiſhing in ſome Ditch, as full of Care and Grief as their Hearts can hold, ignorant, for Anguiſh of Spirit, whether be beſt for them to Dye of Hunger Languiſhing in obſcurity, or to be Slain by the Sword, or to expoſe themſelves a Captive at the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Mercy. For when the Rich Man looſeth his VVealth, it is, as if his Armes were tearing from his Shoulders, or as his Soul
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:171684:18"/> driven out of his Body, and Flying for refuge into the Arms of De<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>vils. But to go on, we may conceive in that Day, Woe alſo to the Voluptuous and looſe Livers, Adulterers, Drunkards, Gameſters, and ſuch like, who know nothing to make diſcourſe on but their fond Pleaſures of Vanity and Folly.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:171684:19"/> Agony of all People at once in the Holy Land, at what time the Flame of the Temple, like the blaze of a mighty Bonfire, aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with violence up to Heaven, then was there an Univerſal Shriek all over the City, and on the Mountains all about, far and wide, every where within Sight of the Fire, the doleful Noiſes, anſwered with Mutual Outcrys, and moſt bitter Moan; And as if it had been their only remaining pleaſure to bewail, there was no end of their Lamentation. For on the Temple of the Lord, as they called it, having fondly ſet their Hearts, when they ſaw it on a Light Flame, it repreſented in their Phantaſies, as if the Body it ſelf had been an Hell-Fire, where remained no more Hopes but that the Soul alſo muſt needs Periſh. Now in our Days we have no ſuch Temple to Lament, but yet every Man has his <hi>Diana,</hi> which is as great in his Imagination as was <hi>Diana</hi> with the People of <hi>Epheſus:</hi> which when it happens to be deſtroyed, our whole hopes do fail therewith: and when a Mans Heart fails, it is, as when the Foundation of an Houſe gives way, at what time, beſure the whole Building is to Periſh therewith; while the Spirit bears up, it bears all Calamities, but when the Spirit is once wounded, then a Mans burthen immediately becomes inſupportable.

And ſuch is the like to be the Torment of the enſuing Threatning Times, So much therefore may ſerve for this three-fold Deſcription. I come next unto Application.</p>
            <p>If things ſtand thus, as we have the warranty of Chriſt and of <hi>Daniel</hi> for it. Then what kind of Perſons ought we to be, and that in all admonition of ſolid Reaſon, as well as in Obedience to the Dictates of Conſcience and Duty. The anſwer is obvious, For there is but one Path to follow that beſpeaks ſafety, (all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being viſibly defeated) and that is, to purſue the Peace of God, which conſiſteth in theſe few Rules,</p>
            <p>1ſt, <hi>Set your Affections upon things above, and not on things here</hi>

But in Chriſt <note place="margin">

            <p>The truth is, The Natural Man perceiveth not the things (the <label type="milestone">

But yet 1ſt, He may perceive, that there be ſome that have that Faculty, and by Vertue thereof do deſpiſe the World, in Compariſon of thoſe things of Heaven, which by Eaith they do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.

The importunity therefore of Eminent Dangerous Times, Pregnantly requires and Commands, as we hope to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and do render our own welfare, both here and for ever, to take and follow ſuch an Effectual Courſe, as may ſerve us, come the worſt come, that can come.</p>
            <p>But here again will ſome ſay, and confeſs, that it may be good <label type="milestone">

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:171684:20"/> is matter of ſo great difficulty, that we have no hopes to compaſs it, and beſides the Afflictions by the way thereto, are ſo Sharp and Severe, that without ſome incouragement from the things of the Fleſh, which naturally we underſtand, there is no Subſiſting.</p>

And Habit conſiſteth in the Practice of uſe, which makes endurance eaſie. The Labouror, by his uſe and habit of Labour, can abide to dig all Day, with as much eaſe, as a Gentleman ſtands by, and looks on.

Our Duty is therefore to conſider the Vertue and Glory, as well as the Neceſſity of the Work, in ſetting our Affections on things above, and ſo put our ſelves upon the means, with all poſſible Diligence in the Practice, and we ſhall ſoon find Experience enough of Divine helps, giving Encouragement, ſo as no Difficulty ſhall be able to diſhearten.</p>

But in theſe caſes wiſe Men do become, and that by their own Act, Sots and Fools, and expoſe, and lay open themſelves to be baffled, betrayed, abaſed, and killed, and to become odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to God and Man, a Prey to the Enemy, and God ſhall nor pity them, nor revenge their wrongs. Now the Righteous do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo become a Prey unto the Enemy many times, by Gods Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for Tryal of Faith and Patience, and other Reaſons, but then here is their comfort, 1ſt, That it is not through their own default, nor for want of Eyes, or looking about them, but meerly for that they were abuſed, and they Suffer for Conſcience and Truth, and Righteouſneſs; &amp; 2dly, That God will before or after Death be ſure <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 18.</note> to avenge their Cauſe. But now if the Righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, but have alſo their Hell even in this Life, where ſhall the ungodly and the wicked appear.
